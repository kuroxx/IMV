<!-- ## Loops

## Objects/classes

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [x] Your program uses at least one object

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [x] Your objects have functions attached
- [x] Use of classes or constructors
- [x] Parameterised functions

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] All of the functionality relating to your objects is functions attatched to the object
- [x] Almost all of the functionality of the program is in objects
- [ ] A design involving many objects that interact with eachother

# Bonus

## Using language features not taught

- [x] Use of some significant language features not used in the course (1 mark)
- [ ] Use of many advanced javascript features in highly competent and professional ways (3 marks)
- [ ] Marco hasn't heard of half the stuff in this program (5 marks)

## Program complexity

- [ ] This is one of the most complex programmes in the lab in terms of amount of code and quality of design. beyond 1st year level, tackling 2nd or 3rd year level problems (1 mark)
- [ ] Approaching professional level software (3 marks)
- [ ] One of the most impressive pieces of software I've ever used (5 marks) -->
