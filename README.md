# **Musicus - (Y1 Intro to Programming Term 2 Project)**
An interactive music visualiser.

It allows the user to compose music through playing various sounds and altering the visuals being displayed.

## How to play
- Use the MOUSE to select a song in the top left corner to play (only 1 can be played at a time / click it again to stop it)

- Click and drag the mouse to draw a trail of rain which can be used to trigger the two square boxes at the centre of the screen. (Place your mouse above the squares and click and drag your mouse in an upwards motion*)

- Use the ARROW KEYS to play beats moving along the horizontal axis

- Use the SPACEBAR to switch between screens (Screen one graphs the amplitude of the sound / Screen two displays randomly generated stars that respond to the amplitude of the sound)

(* NB Stop triggering to play the sound more than once.
  A.K.A Don't spam the trail of rains on the square to play the sound again)

Enjoy and have fun! :)

# **Marking Criteria**

Here I have created a checklist based on the mark scheme.
I have ticked off sections I believe that I have completed.
(Bonus marking criteria is NOT included).

My Term 2 targets are as follows (WIP grade = 7.6/10 ):
1. Try to incorporate nested For Loops and 2D arrays in my program.
2. Using random access or insertion/splicing of arrays.
3. Using break and returns in For Loops.

## *Variables & if statements*

### Baseline (4 marks)
- [x] Basic program with setup and draw

### Basic (max 2 marks)
- [x] At least 1 variable
- [x] At least 1 if statement
- [x] Several variables

### Advanced (max 2 marks)
- [x] Nested if statements
- [x] Boolean variables
- [x] Complex boolean conditions

## *Loops*

### Baseline (4 marks)
- [x] Your program uses at lease one basic loop

### Basic (max 2 marks)
- [x] Many loops
- [x] Nested loop
- [x] Using the loop variable

### Advanced (max 2 marks)
- [x] Non-standard loop (e.g. backwards)
- [x] Searching or otherwise breaking out of loops with break or return
- [x] While loop

## *Arrays*

### Baseline (4 marks)
- [x] Your program uses at least one basic array

### Basic (max 2 marks)
- [x] Loops with arrays
- [x] Functional programming (map, filter, reduce, etc)
- [x] Arrays of objects

### Advanced (max 2 marks)
- [x] 2D arrays
- [ ] Random access of arrays
- [x] Random insertion/splicing arrays

## *Functions*

### Baseline (4 marks)
- [x] Your program uses at least one function defined by you

### Basic (max 2 marks)
- [x] Most of your code is in your own functions not draw, setup etc
- [x] Parameterised functions  
- [x] Return values

### Advanced (max 2 marks)
- [x] Anonymous functions
- [x] Functions that return different things depending on conditions or use conditions to return at different points in the function
- [x] Passing functions as arguments

## *Objects/classes*

### Baseline (4 marks)
- [x] Your program uses at least one object

### Basic (max 2 marks)
- [x] Your objects have functions attached
- [x] Use of classes or constructors
- [x] Parameterised functions

### Advanced (max 2 marks)
- [x] All of the functionality relating to your objects is functions attached to the object
- [x] Almost all of the functionality of the program is in objects
- [x] A design involving many objects that interact with each other
